            <h2>About Schdo</h2>
            <p>Schdo is an Microsoft Outlook App and website, designed to intelligently help you organize appointments with multiple attendees. When planning an appointment with many attendees with busy schedules it can be difficult to find an open spot in everybody's calendar. Even more so if you are planning meeting with people outside your organization where you might not have access to their calendar information.</p>
            <p>
                Schdo turns the appointment planning process around. Instead of trying to find a suitable date and time, that gets rescheduled a number of times, you send a simple poll to all attendees that allows them to provide feedback on dates and times where they are available. As the appointment organizer you decide which dates and times you want feedback on, and everyone invited can always see each others answers. When a suitable date and time have been found, you can go ahead an book the meeting.
